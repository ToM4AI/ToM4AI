# ToM4AI Initiative

**ToM4AI (Theory of Mind for Artificial Intelligence) is a collaborative research initiative dedicated to advancing our understanding of Theory of Mind (ToM) and its application to artificial intelligence.**

## About ToM4AI

ToM4AI brings together scientists from diverse backgrounds to explore how machines can be endowed with the ability to reason about the beliefs, intentions, and perspectives of othersâ€”core aspects of Theory of Mind. Our mission is to bridge the gap between cognitive science and AI, fostering research, workshops, and educational resources that push the boundaries of what intelligent systems can achieve.

## Our Team

The ToM4AI initiative is led by four core members:

- **Nitay Alon**
- **Joseph M. Barnby**
- **Reuth Mirsky**
- **Stefan Sarkadi**
