## AAAI-2025

The inaugural Theory of Mind for AI (ToM4AI) workshop at AAAI 2025 brought together a multidisciplinary community to explore the diverse and evolving role of Theory of Mind in modern AI. The event served as a dynamic forum for researchers to discuss how and why ToM can (and should) enrich artificial intelligence systems.

The workshop featured keynote presentations from world-renowned scholars, including Rebecca Saxe and Joshua Tenenbaum (MIT), Sheila McIlraith (University of Toronto), and Harmen de Weerd (University of Groningen), offering deep insights into the intersection of cognitive science, machine learning, and multi-agent reasoning.

In addition to the keynotes, the workshop included spotlight poster sessions and interactive roundtable discussions, fostering engaging dialogue and interdisciplinary exchange.

The proceedings, featuring 28 contributed papers, are available on arXiv: [arxiv.org/abs/2505.03770](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03770)
