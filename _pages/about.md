The **Theory of Mind for AI (ToM4AI)** initiative is a multidisciplinary effort dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence by integrating principles of human social cognition.

Launched at the AAAI 2025 conference, ToM4AI brings together researchers from cognitive science, machine learning, and multi-agent systems to explore how Theory of Mind (ToM)—the ability to attribute mental states like beliefs, desires, and intentions to oneself and others—can enhance AI capabilities.
